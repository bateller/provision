~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00045
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

This document outlines the various Image Deploy plugin supportted image formats.


Solution
--------

Current documentation on Image Deploy can be found at:

  * https://provision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/content-packages/image-deploy.html

The ``image-deploy/image-type`` param specifies which type of supported image to deploy.
When you set this Param on a machine, it is validated against an Enum type list of the
supported image types - so you can not set this value to an unsupported image type.

According to the Param type definition, the currently supported types are:

  * ``tgz`` - Tar gzip compress filesystem
  * ``dd-tgz`` - tar file containing a single gzip compressed disk image
  * ``dd-txz`` - tar file containing a single XV compressed disk image`
  * ``dd-tbz`` - tar file containing a single BZ compressed disk image`
  * ``dd-tar`` - tar file containing a single uncompressed disk image`
  * ``dd-bz2`` - tar file containing a single BZ2 compressed disk image`
  * ``dd-gz`` - raw disk image that is gzip compressed
  * ``dd-xz`` - raw disk image that is XZ compressed`
  * ``dd-raw`` - raw disk image that is uncompressed

.. note:: For the most up to date list, see the Param definition link in *See Also*,
          below or the Param type definition in your DRP Endpoint.

Description
-----------

The default method for discovering and managing Machine lifecycle is via the in-band
DHCP and PXE boot control path.  This method has proven to be vastly more scalable,
require fewer resources on the provisioning host side, and is more flexible in
regards to network topologies.

However, it may be necessary from time to time to boot systems by attaching an ISO
to the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) via the "VirtualMedia" mechanism.  This
knowledge base provides references to how that process works in Digital Rebar Platform (DRP).


Solution
--------

The :ref:`rs_virtualmedia_iso_booting` contains detailed information and help on
how this process works in the Digital Rebar Platform (DRP>.

.. warning::  The VirtualMedia ISO Booting process is a *Tech Preview* feature, and
              is subject to change over time until it is officially released.
